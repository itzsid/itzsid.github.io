title: 'Softwares that I use in everyday life'
---
I am writing down the list of softwares that I use everyday. This is for my own backup and for anyone who 
is interested in knowing about it. 
1. Eclipse IDE: I have been using Eclipse for the last one year. Before that I used to code completely in VIM but recently I have started to like Eclipse due to its capability to handle large projects smoothly.

2. [Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html): For all the other purposes like running roscore, rviz, bag files, launching code et al., I use terminator. I have a dual screen and on one screen I have eclipse and on the other screen I have terminator. Below is the screenshot of my screens.

3. [Lyx](http://lyx.org): I use LyX for writing papers and I found it much better than other LaTeX editors. Writing mathematical derivations in LyX is very easy and one should definitely try it atleast once. 

4. [GitHub](http://github.com/itzsid/): I use Git as a version control system for all my codes and papers. You can request a <a href='https://github.com/edu'>free micro plan</a> if you are a student. Right now most of my projects are in private mode and I plan to release them soon. 

5. [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/): I use Zotero to organize the research papers I read into different collections. While browsing through papers, organizing papers is as easy as bookmarking them with a single mouse click.

6. [MindMup](http://www.mindmup.com/): MindMup is a free and opensource mind mapping software that I use to organize the ideas, to-do lists, papers etc. It can save the map to google drive or github.

7. [ROS](http://ros.org): If you are working in Robotics or Computer Vision, this is the thing you should know. RViz itself is sufficient reason to use ROS in your code.

8. [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/): I use it for all the plotting and analysis purposes. I do not experiment in MATLAB itself. 

9. Miscellaneous: Other than these, some of the websites that I rely on these days is <a href='http://calendar.google.com'>Google Calendar</a>, <a href='http://gmail.com'>GMail</a> and <a href='http://feedly.com'>Feedly</a>

These are all the things I can remember right now. I will keep adding to the list as I remember them. 

That is all for now. Cya.
