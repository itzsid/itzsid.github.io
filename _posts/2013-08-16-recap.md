Last month I was attended an awesome computer vision summer school held at UCLA and organized
by IPAM. You can see the schedule at <a href='https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/schedule.aspx?pc=gss2013'>https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/schedule.aspx?pc=gss2013</a>. Some of the nice things about this workshop
was that it was fully funded by IPAM and NSF and along with that they called in a nice set of 
speakers like Donald Geman (of Geman and Geman fame), Stanley Osher (level sets), Yi Ma et al. to give lectures and interact with us. All the vision enthusiasts stayed together for three weeks.
Other than these, we got to see a lot of places in Los Angeles as well.

This is me at Santa Monica Pier.

After all the travel, I have resumed work now. Recently I have been facing a lot of bugs, so I thought of keeping a note from now on. The most recent one is when I declared a class as a member variable of another class like:

{% highlight cpp %}
class A:
public:
    A();

protected:
    B temp;
   {% endhighlight %}

But this is not the right way, since it never constructs B. So, the right way to do so is:

{% highlight cpp %}
class A:
public:
A():temp();

protected:
B temp;
   {% endhighlight %}

This is all for now. Cya.
