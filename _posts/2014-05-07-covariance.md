title: 'Covariance Projection'
---
Covariance Projection is a useful tool which is frequently used in Robotics and SLAM. I wrote a small document explaining covariance projection.

It can be accessed from <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~choudhar/misc/covariance_projection.pdf">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~choudhar/misc/covariance_projection.pdf</a>.
