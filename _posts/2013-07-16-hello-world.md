As for a formal introduction, I am a PhD student in the School of Interactive Computing, which is a part of College of Computing at Georgia Tech. Here I am associated with Cognitive Robotics and BORG lab and I am being advised by Henrik I. Christensen and Frank Dellaert. My primary research interests are Computer and Robotic Vision and its intersection with Machine Learning and High Performance Computing. I am currently working in the area of autonomous navigation in known environments.
